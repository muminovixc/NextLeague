## üß∞ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- React, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap (depending on your setup)

**Backend:**
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL or MySQL (configurable)
- SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM

- ## üí≥ Online Payments & VIP

- Users can upgrade to VIP plans for additional features and capacity.
- Payments are processed securely via [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
- After payment, user accounts are automatically upgraded.
- See `frontend/src/components/vip_cards/vip_cards.jsx` and `backend/controllers/vip_controller.py` for implementation details.

### How it works

1. User selects a VIP plan and clicks "Upgrade".
2. The app creates a Stripe Checkout session and redirects the user.
3. After successful payment, the backend verifies the session and upgrades the user.

> **Note:** You must set your Stripe API keys in environment variables for both frontend and backend.

**Other:**
- REST API
- Git & GitHub
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Railway/Render/Docker (backend)
